Human resources in sciences and technologies in EU

As I am finishing my PhD, I was interesting in different tendencies in working in science. 

In R-package "eurostat" I found little dataset, containing information about percentage of people engaging in science and technology in Europe. I have chosen 5 the most interesting countries for me: Austria (AT), Germany (DE), Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL) and France (FR); and also EU-28 refers to all countries, including Croatia. 

I added the code to "analyze gender distribution" file.
